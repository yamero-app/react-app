        que: "What're the most eye opening lines you have read in a novel?",
        ans: 'In his award winning book, Guns, Germs and Steel, anthropologist and biologist Jared Diamond points out simple fact: different continents have different shapes. Everybody knows about it and it is obvious, what so different about it? But it has great impact on human behaviour. The primary axis for North America, South America and Africa runs from North to South. These continents are tall and thin around the axis. But look at Europe, Asia, Middle East. Most of the land stretch is across East-West. According to biologist Diamond this difference in shape played a major role in the spread of agriculture over the centuries. When agriculture began to expand farmers had easier time expanding along east-west routes than along the north -south ones. This is due to the fact that locations along the same lattitude generally share similar climates, rainfalls, amount of sunlight and changes in season. This facts allowed the farmers of Asia, Europe to domesticate a few crops and grow them along the entire stretch of land from France to China.'

        ans: "How Elon Musk's car collection has evolved over the years, from the million-dollar McLaren F1 he destroyed to a James Bond movie prop Lotus AVERY HARTMANSJUL 18, 2020, 04:10 IST How Elon Musk's car collection has evolved over the years, from the million-dollar McLaren F1 he destroyed to a James Bond movie prop Lotus Tesla CEO Elon Musk.Maurizio Pesce Tesla CEO Elon Musk has had a lot of different cars over the years. His first vehicle was a 1978 BMW 320i â€” he paid only $1,400 for it. At one point, a McLaren F1 was his daily driver, but he totaled it on Sand Hill Road in Silicon Valley. More recently, he's been driving Tesla cars, like Model S and the Cybertruck. He even sent his Tesla Roadster into space. Elon Musk has had quite the car collection over the years. Some got totaled, others inspired certain design elements in the cars Tesla makes today. Either way, each says a little bit about what Musk looks for in a car. These days, Musk is usually seen cruising around in a Tesla Model S â€” unless, of course, he takes the upcoming Tesla Cybertruck out for a spin. Here's a closer look at Musk's car collection over the years."

        ans: 'He was quarantined after getting infected by COVID-19. The reason he got infected by COVID-19 is, he removed his PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) kit to put a ventilator on an extremely critical COVID-19 patient to prevent a cardiac arrest. Dr. Zahid had to remove his PPE (goggles and face-shield) to re-intubate the patient on the way to the hospitalâ€™s trauma center in an ambulance. When the transfer was happening, he realized that the patientâ€™s tube was mal-positioned and that without immediate intervention, the patient would go into cardiac arrest. In a dim-lit ambulance, working with PPE wasnâ€™t a viable option for him so he quickly removed the face-shield and goggles to perform the procedure. He immediately reported the breach in PPE and officials advised him to proceed to quarantine.'
